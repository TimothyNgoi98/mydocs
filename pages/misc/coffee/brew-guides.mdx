### V60 Recipes

#### Recipe 1

What you will need: 
- V60 Dripper
- Paper Filter
- Scale
- 14 grams of coffee beans/pre-ground coffee
- 230 grams of water just off the boil

Steps:
- Place the filter paper into the V60 and give it a quick rinse to get rid of any papery tastes
- Heat your water up, anywhere between 92-96 degrees. If you do not have a temperature controlled kettle, it's best to let it boil and then sit for a minute.
- Place the coffee into the brewer with the rinsed filter paper
- Place your V60 and vessel onto the scale and tare them off. This allows you to take note of how much water you are using as you brew the coffee
- Start a timer and then slowly pour 30 grams of water, aiming to cover and wet all the coffee. This is known as the "Bloom". During the bloom, CO2 escapes from the coffee grounds. 
- At 1 minute, pour up to 100 grams. 
- At 1 minute and 30 seconds, pour up to 230 grams. The brewing process should be completed in about in about 3 to 4 minutes. 

Things you can tweak/play around with:
- Grind size 
- Water temperature 
- Bloom time, can go anywhere from 30seconds to 2 minutes
